Tdmglob provides the functionality of the perl builtin glob function. The builtin glob 
does not work on the Tandem port of Perl for NSK(Guardian). This provided the motivation
for writing the above module.

Tdmglob is used like any other perl module. In order to expand the filenames corresponding
to a template containing wild characters, make a call to the functoin tdmglob, provided in 
the Tdmglob module.

For example:

@file = tdmglob("$xyz.*.d*y");

or 

while ($_=tdmglob("$xyz.*.d*y") {
  #do your processing.
}


As shown in the example, you can call tdmglob in either list context, or in scalar context
and it behaves very much like builtin glob function in either case.
